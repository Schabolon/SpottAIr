## What it does

Spottair is an AI Biomechanics Expert that shifts the focus from Volume to Technique.

Quality Over Quantity: While other apps celebrate that you did 10 reps, Spottair might tell you, "Only 6 of those counted. The last 4 lacked depth." It enforces a standard of excellence.
Zero-Friction Context: You don't enter data. You just move. Spottair observes your session and logs not just the numbers, but the integrity of the session.
Injury Prevention Protocol: It identifies "Form Fatigue" - the exact moment your technique breaks down - and advises you to stop, preventing "junk volume" training. Your rep count increases only when you have fully completed one set.
